##Overview

In the context of advancing my understanding of TypeScript and its practical applications in web development, I've developed a simple yet comprehensive software: a Budget Tracker. This software demonstrates the use of TypeScript in building interactive web applications that can perform CRUD operationsâ€”specifically, creating and deleting financial records. My aim was to explore TypeScript's type safety features and its integration with the DOM to manage user interactions effectively.

The Budget Tracker is designed to help users manage their finances by allowing them to add and remove income and expense items. It showcases the dynamic nature of TypeScript in handling arrays of objects, event listeners, and local storage manipulation. This project served as an excellent opportunity to deepen my grasp of TypeScript syntax, especially in defining types and interfaces, and employing them to ensure the application runs reliably and error-free.



For this project, I utilized Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my integrated development environment (IDE). VSCode offers excellent support for TypeScript, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection, which significantly enhances the development experience.

The primary language used was TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any browser, host, or OS. For this project, no additional libraries were used outside of TypeScript's standard library, focusing on keeping the application straightforward and focused on core language features.
Useful Websites

During the development of the Budget Tracker, several websites proved invaluable for understanding TypeScript's nuances and for troubleshooting:

    TypeScript Documentation
    MDN Web Docs

These resources provided comprehensive guides and reference materials on TypeScript and web APIs, facilitating a smooth development process.
Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and expansion in the Budget Tracker project:

UI/UX Enhancements: Improve the user interface and experience by adding more interactive elements and visual feedback for operations.
Category Management: Implement functionality to categorize items and filter the view based on categories.
Data Visualization: Integrate charts or graphs to provide visual summaries of income and expenses over time.
